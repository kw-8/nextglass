## Background and Overview
Make finding drinks easier. Rather than asking around, get recommendations from what you like. Let's try to find your ***NextGlass***!

## Functionality and MVP
- User auth: sign up, login, logout
- Collection: create, edit, delete
- Collection page
- Landing page with categories
- Production README
- Team Links

### Bonus Features
- Search
- Future: suggestions with tensorflow

## Technologies and Technical Challenges
### Backend: MongoDB and Express
- Relevant data is stored in columns
  - Some of the columns contains an array, containing some of 50+ tags
- Tables: users, collections, wines

Technical Challenges:
- Fetching data efficiently. We leveraged mongodb search index to enable fuzzy searching.
- Cleaning data. We used excel to:
  -  Remove all incomplete entries
  -  Create a list of common tags from the content of the descriptions
  -  Remove entries without the most common tags
  -  Trim down the 130k dataset to 10k
- Manipulating data
  -  Original data on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
  -  [split.js](https://github.com/kw-8/nextglass/blob/main/split.js) contains the final code we used to change the tags and tagindex data from strings to arrays
  -  [symbols.js](https://github.com/kw-8/nextglass/blob/main/symbols.js) contains the final code we used to update the description data to use UTF-8 characters

### Frontend: React, Redux, Axios
- Landing page contains images linked to curated collections

Technical Challenges:
- Double fetching- fetching a collection, and then dependent wines. Final solution using thenable promises, as componentDidUpdate will be deprecated.
- Creating a recommendation model for suggesting drinks based on tags from the current collection
- Reading data from the MongoDB database to feed into the recommendation model
